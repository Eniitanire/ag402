# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Ag402 handles private keys and financial transactions. We take security extremely seriously.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **aethercore.dev@proton.me**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Design

- **Non-custodial**: Private keys never leave your machine.
- **PBE Encryption**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (480K iterations) + Fernet/AES for key-at-rest protection. Atomic file writes (tempfile + os.replace) prevent crash-induced corruption. Minimum 8-character password enforced.
- **6-Layer Budget Guard**: Single-TX cap, per-minute cap, daily cap, circuit breaker, auto-rollback, key filter. Budget check + deduction are serialized under asyncio.Lock to prevent TOCTOU race conditions.
- **Zero Telemetry**: No usage tracking, no IP logging, no analytics.
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamp + nonce validation on gateway side. Nonce length limit (128 chars) and cache-full flood rejection prevent abuse.
- **tx_hash Deduplication**: Atomic `INSERT OR IGNORE` in SQLite eliminates TOCTOU race conditions on concurrent requests.
- **Sender Verification**: On-chain payment verification validates that the claimed payer's token balance decreased, preventing stolen tx_hash attacks.
- **Production Mode Safety**: Gateway refuses to start without a real payment verifier when X402_MODE=production.
- **Protocol Input Validation**: Amount fields reject NaN, Infinity, zero, and negative values. Header serialization sanitizes CR/LF/quote to prevent HTTP response splitting.
- **SSRF Protection**: Forward Proxy blocks CONNECT tunnels to private/loopback/link-local/reserved IPs and restricts to standard web ports (80/443/8080/8443).
- **Header Whitelist**: Gateway proxy forwards only known-safe request headers; strips Cookie, X-Forwarded-For, Connection, etc.
- **Health Monitoring**: `GET /health` endpoint exposes gateway status, mode, uptime, and request/payment/error metrics.
- **Configurable Finality**: SolanaAdapter supports "confirmed" (fast) or "finalized" (safe) commitment levels for chain reorg protection. Returns `confirmation_status` ("confirmed" | "sent") in PaymentResult for clarity.
- **Localhost Detection**: Challenge validator uses `ipaddress` module for complete loopback/local address detection (IPv4, IPv6, 0.0.0.0).
- **Gateway Rate Limiting**: IP-based sliding-window rate limiter (configurable, default 60 req/min) returns HTTP 429 to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **RPC Retry + Failover**: SolanaAdapter automatically retries failed RPC calls with exponential backoff, then fails over to backup RPC endpoint (`SOLANA_RPC_BACKUP_URL`). Prevents single-point-of-failure on RPC outages.

## V1 Security Audit Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed on V1, identifying 24 issues across 4 severity levels:

| Severity | Found | Fixed | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| **P0 — Critical** | 5 | 5 | All fixed |
| **P1 — High** | 7 | 7 | All fixed |
| **P2 — Medium** | 7 | 7 | All fixed |
| **P3 — Low** | 5 | 0 | Deferred to V2 |

Total: 447 tests passing (up from 316 pre-audit), 0 regressions.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow a responsible disclosure process. After a fix is available, we will:
1. Credit the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity)
2. Publish a security advisory on GitHub
3. Release a patched version
